Heurisctic Search 
Problem Statement:
Multiple bombings have been sighted in different locations in Hyderabad. Each is located at
position (xi, yi), having possible casualty counts of ci. Bomb at each location has a time (ti)
to go off. The city has only a single bomb squad team. The time taken to diffuse a bomb is
constant. The time taken by the team to reach from one place to another place is proportional
to the distance between the two points. Your task is to design a search algorithm with proper
heuristics that may help in minimising the casualty count. Reason out why you have picked
certain heuristics. Analyse the space and time complexity of your algorithm
